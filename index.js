// Note: this is the entry point for the entire application

// step 1: you will need to load the pizza data. it is available at /pizza.json. what-wg fetch is pre-installed,
// so you may use that, or install another http client. remember that fetch uses promises.

// like this: `ReactDOM.render(<Filter />, document.querySelector('.content'));` somewhere in the application
